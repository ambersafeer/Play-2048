## Play 2048 CS112 Homework

This homework was assigned to test student abilities to manipulate arrays, navigate references to objects, and practice the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm.
As a student, I worked on the "Board" class, editing the empty methods to achieve proper gameplay mechanics.

You can test the file by opening the executable titled "Play2048.jar". The controls are through the keyboard, using the WASD configuration:
### W - Move up
### A - Move left
### S - Move down
### D - Move right
